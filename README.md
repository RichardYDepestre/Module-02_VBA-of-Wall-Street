# stock-analysis
##  Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
    - This project showcases the scripting features of Visual Basic for Application. \With the tool we will script instructions to analyze stock data for the year 2017, 2018. \In addition, the result of our analysis will be confined to a result cheet showing the ticker symbols, as tracked, respective their returns. \Since we are dealing with code we will refactor it and make it as efficient as can be done. \
## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
    - Refactoring helps pinpoint flaws of contructs in one's code. It offers great opportunity to improve mechanisms with metrics captured through execution. \In this challenge, I have included the 'DoEvents' keyword in areas where significant number crunching was taking place. The idea was to insure that calculations run to completion. I turns out that the addition of 'DoEvents' added a whoping 3 seconds to the overall execution of the code.
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
